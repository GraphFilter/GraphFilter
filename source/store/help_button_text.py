equation = "<p> On this screen, you can insert a condition like as mathematical equation or inequality, using " \
               "the numeric invariants and operations. Each one must be applied to a graph, as a function “f(G)” and" \
               " compositions. Conditions can be combined using logical connectors AND or OR. <br> Examples:" \

method = "<p> The 'Filter graphs'' will filter a list of graphs and return all those that satisfy the conditions " \

conditions = "<p> In this screen you will enter the conditions of the true/false type. If you want filtering to " \

files = "<p> In this screen you must insert the files containing the lists of the graphs to be analyzed. The " \
