equation = "<p> On this screen, you can insert a condition like as mathematical equation or inequality, using " \

method = "<p> The 'Filter graphs'' will filter a list of graphs and return all those that satisfy the conditions " \

conditions = "<p> In this screen you will enter the conditions of the true/false type. If you want filtering to " \
                 "satisfy condition X, then mark it as true. If you want X not to be satisfied, check false. If it is" \

files = "<p> In this screen you must insert the files containing the lists of the graphs to be analyzed. The " \
